## Technical Requirements

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Bootstrap 5
- **Backend**: Next.js 14 + SQLite + Drizzle ORM
- **Security**: JWT authentication + client-side encryption (Argon2, CryptoJS)
- **Development**: Concurrent frontend/backend development environment

### Performance Requirements
- **Page Load Time**: < 3 seconds for initial load
- **API Response Time**: < 500ms for basic operations
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized for production deployment
- **Database Performance**: Efficient queries with proper indexing

### Security Requirements
- **Data Encryption**: Client-side encryption for sensitive data
- **Authentication**: Secure JWT implementation with refresh tokens
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation on both frontend and backend

## Business Requirements

### Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Basic integration and authentication (Priority 1)
- **Phase 2**: Core CRUD functionality (Priority 2)
- **Phase 3**: Polish and documentation (Priority 3)
- **Flexible**: Timeline driven by functionality completion rather than fixed dates

### Resource Constraints
- **Development**: Self-directed development approach
- **Budget**: Focus on free/open-source solutions
- **Infrastructure**: Self-hosted deployment model

### Deployment Model
- **Environment**: Self-hosted template for future SaaS development
- **Scalability**: Foundation that can be extended for production use
- **Distribution**: Template repository for cloning/forking

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success Metrics
1. **Integration Completeness**
   - Frontend successfully connects to backend APIs
   - Authentication flow works end-to-end
   - Basic CRUD operations functional through UI
   - No critical security vulnerabilities

2. **Template Usability**
   - Clear setup documentation
   - Working development environment
   - Successful build/deployment process
   - Modular, extensible codebase

3. **Performance Benchmarks**
   - Fast development server startup

- **Architecture Clarity**: Easy to understand and extend
- **Development Workflow**: Smooth development and testing process

---

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with existing Rasket and Doctor-Dok features
- No breaking changes to core functionality of either template
- Self-contained solution without external service dependencies
- Cross-platform compatibility required

### Project Constraints
- Template-focused scope (not production application)
- Minimal external dependencies
- Self-hosted deployment model
- Developer-friendly documentation required

### Assumptions
- Developers using this template have basic React/Next.js knowledge
- Template will be used as starting point, not final product
- Future customization and extension expected
- Standard web development tools and practices

---

## Out of Scope

### Excluded Features
- AI/ML functionality integration
- Advanced medical records features (template agnostic)
- Production-ready deployment configuration
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Third-party service integrations
- Mobile app development
- Advanced security auditing

### Future Considerations
- AI feature integration for specialized use cases
- Advanced theming and customization options
- Plugin/extension system
- Production deployment guides
- Performance optimization guides

---

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Integration Complexity**: Different architectures may require significant adaptation
- **Authentication Conflicts**: JWT system may need substantial modification
- **Performance Impact**: Combined system may be slower than individual templates

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental Integration**: Phase-based approach with testing at each step
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined APIs between frontend and backend
- **Performance Monitoring**: Regular performance testing during development

---

## Acceptance Criteria
