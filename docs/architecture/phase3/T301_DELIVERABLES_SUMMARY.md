- Complexity assessment for each component (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Identified high-priority components for Phase 3a
- Documented styling migration strategy (Tailwind → Bootstrap)

### 2. Migration Plan ✅
**Location**: `/docs/architecture/phase3/MIGRATION_PLAN.md`

**Contents**:
- 6-week phased migration timeline
- Component-by-component migration order
- Dependency analysis and critical paths
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Rollback procedures
- Success metrics and quality gates

### 3. Migration Scaffolding Structure ✅
**Location**: `/apps/combined-template/`

- Custom utility classes for migration compatibility
- Mixins for common component patterns

## Key Insights from Analysis

### 1. Compatibility Wins
- ✅ Both systems use react-hook-form (major compatibility win)
- ✅ Lucide icons work in both systems
- ✅ No circular dependencies detected

### 2. Migration Priorities
**High Priority (Week 1-2)**:
- UI primitives (buttons, inputs, forms)
- Authorization components
- Basic layout structure

**Medium Priority (Week 3-4)**:
- Data display components
- Navigation header
- Modal/popup conversions

**Low Priority (Week 5-6)**:
- Advanced features (chat, voice recording)
- Specialized components
- Polish and optimization

### 3. Major Challenges Identified
1. **Chat System** - Complex real-time functionality
2. **Theme System** - Different approaches (CSS vars vs SCSS)
3. **File Upload** - Security considerations with encryption
4. **Navigation Header** - Complex component requiring significant refactor

### 4. Migration Strategy Recommendations
- Use parallel tracks for independent components
- Maintain dual component strategy during transition
- Focus on maintaining feature parity
- Implement comprehensive testing at each phase

## Success Criteria Met

- [x] All Doctor-Dok UI components catalogued and mapped
- [x] Rasket equivalent identified for each component
- [x] Migration complexity assessed for each component
- [x] Phase 3 directory structure created
- [x] Migration dependencies mapped
- [x] Testing strategy defined

## Next Steps for Phase 3 Implementation

1. **Phase 3a** (Week 1-2): Begin with UI primitives migration
2. **Set up testing infrastructure** using the provided testing strategy
3. **Create Storybook** for side-by-side component comparison
4. **Implement dual component loading** for gradual rollout
5. **Start with Button component** as proof of concept

## Additional Resources Created

1. **Migration workspace** ready for development
2. **Style compatibility layer** for Tailwind → Bootstrap
3. **Component migration pattern** examples
4. **Comprehensive testing framework** outlined
5. **Risk mitigation strategies** documented

---

**Summary**: The Phase 3 scaffolding is complete with comprehensive documentation, clear migration paths, and a structured approach to systematically migrate from Doctor-Dok's custom UI to Rasket's Bootstrap 5 based system. The analysis reveals a complex but manageable migration with clear priorities and mitigation strategies for identified risks.
