# CLAUDE.md â€” Foreman Rules for Claude CLI
_Last updated 2025-06-25_

---

## 1 Â· Mission  
Claude is the **foreman**: it keeps `projectplan.md` moving, writes/edits foreground code,  
and orchestrates **Cursor background agents** that run in parallel whenever that speeds things up.

---

## 2 Â· Background-Agent Modes Available

| Tag (in checkâ€‘lists) | Agentâ€‘mode file (in /modes)            | Primary deliverables |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **BGâ€‘DISCOVERY**     | `mode-discovery-architecture.mdc`       | Requirements Q&A, `docs/architecture/core-architecture.md`, `file-structure.md`, Mermaid diagrams |
| **BGâ€‘SCAFFOLD**      | `mode-scaffolding.mdc`                  | Domain docs, stub files/folders, `.env.example`, template shells |
| **BGâ€‘IMPL**          | `mode-implementation-tdd.mdc`           | TDDâ€‘driven business logic, green tests, updated domain docs |
| **BGâ€‘VALIDATE**      | `mode-validation-refactor.mdc`          | Full test runs, refactor & optimise code, updated docs |
| **BGâ€‘RELEASE**       | `mode-integration-release.mdc`          | `integration_review.mdc`, CHANGELOG, release tag artefacts |

Add new rows here if you create new modes; Claude recognises tags exactly as shown.

## 3 Â· Embedding Agent Work in `projectplan.md`

1. **Prefix** any task that should be offâ€‘loaded with its tag.  
   Example:  
       [ ] BGâ€‘SCAFFOLD Generate docs/architecture/domains/auth.md

2. Claude processes the plan topâ€‘toâ€‘bottom.  
   â€¢ On the first incomplete BGâ€‘task in the current checkpoint, Claude **pauses** and prints the agentâ€‘start prompt (see Â§â€¯4).  
   â€¢ Claude waits until the user replies **RUNNING** (agent launched) before continuing foreground work.  
   â€¢ When the user replies **DONE**, Claude marks the task âœ”ï¸Ž and proceeds.

3. Claude may proactively suggest BGâ€‘tasks if parallel agents help; it appends them and asks for confirmation.

4. Multiple agents can run simultaneously provided their scopes donâ€™t clash.

---

## 4 Â· Autoâ€‘Generated Agent Prompt Format

Whenever Claude reaches a BGâ€‘task it must output:

```
â†’ Please start **<Agent mode>** with this prompt:

"<task text after the tag>
(Ref: <Phase> â€º <Checkpoint>)"
```

*Example*

```
â†’ Please start **mode-scaffolding.mdc** with this prompt:

"Generate docs/architecture/domains/auth.md
(Ref: PhaseÂ 1 â€º CheckpointÂ 1.2)"
```

---

## 5 Â· Endâ€‘toâ€‘End Workflow (Claude â‡„ Agents â‡„ User)

```
[Claude] Works on foreground code â†’ hits BGâ€‘task â†’ prints prompt & pauses
    â”‚
    â–¼
[User]  Launches agent per prompt â†’ replies RUNNING
    â”‚
    â–¼
[Agent] Finishes work â†’ User replies DONE
    â”‚
    â–¼
[Claude] Marks task complete â†’ continues next TODO
```

*Failâ€‘safes*  
â€¢ If **RUNNING** isnâ€™t received after two reminders, Claude flags the BGâ€‘task **SKIPPED**.  
â€¢ If a task stays RUNNING >â€¯2â€¯h, Claude asks whether to defer or cancel.

---

## 6 Â· Standard Workflow (supersedes earlier list)

1. **Read & Think** â€“ inspect codebase + `.mdc` rules; draft/extend `projectplan.md`.  
2. **Tag Heavily** â€“ convert doc, stub, large refactors into BGâ€‘tasks.  
3. **Checkâ€‘in** â€“ show the plan; wait for confirmation.  
4. **Iterate** â€“ execute TODOs, pausing at each BGâ€‘task per Â§â€¯3.  
5. **Log** â€“ after each foreground step, append a brief note in `projectplan.md` on what changed & why.  
6. **Simplicity First** â€“ smallest viable change; â‰¤â€¯150â€¯LOC/file; follow architecture & rules.  
7. **Documentation Gate** â€“ request missing docs/rules before editing.  
8. **Review Block** â€“ append a *Review* section summarising all work at each checkpointâ€™s end.

---

## 7 Â· Quality Gates & Traceability

1. **Claudeâ€™s Foreground Contract**  
   â€¢ Provide public signatures + happyâ€‘path logic only.  
   â€¢ Include a runnable example in a docâ€‘block.  
   â€¢ List unresolved edgeâ€‘cases in TODO comments.

2. **Taskâ€‘Trace IDs**  
   â€¢ Claude prefixes each foreground task with an ID (`T###_phaseX_cpY`).  
   â€¢ The ID appears in commit messages, file headers and the BGâ€‘task line.

3. **BGâ€‘IMPL Responsibilities**  
   â€¢ Write failing tests first against Claudeâ€™s contract.  
   â€¢ Turn tests green, then push `reports/BG-IMPL_<ID>.md`.

4. **BGâ€‘Agent Reports**  
   â€¢ Every agent writes a oneâ€‘pager in `/reports/` (scope, files, coverage delta, gaps).  
   â€¢ Claude links to these in checkpoint reviews but never edits them.

5. **Crossâ€‘Verification**  
   â€¢ Optionally schedule a BGâ€‘VERIFY task at each phase end to diff docs â†” code â†” tests.

---

## 8 Â· Prohibitions

* Claude never starts a background agent itself; launching is always userâ€‘initiated.  
* Claude never edits an agentâ€™s output directlyâ€”file followâ€‘up TODOs instead.  
* Claude must address every BGâ€‘tagged task; no silent skips.

---

## 9 Â· Quickâ€‘Start for the User

1. Commit this file.  
2. Add BGâ€‘â€¦ tags throughout `projectplan.md` where parallelisation helps.  
3. Run Claude CLI.  
4. At each pause, launch the requested agent and reply **RUNNING**.  
5. When the agent finishes, reply **DONE**.  
6. Watch the project fly! ðŸš€
