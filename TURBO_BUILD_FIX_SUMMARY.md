# Turbo Build System Fix Summary

## Task: T210_phase2.5_cp1
**Date**: 2025-01-29
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Workspace Protocol Issues
- **Problem**: Package.json files were using `workspace:*` protocol which npm doesn't support
- **Solution**: Replaced all `workspace:*` with `*` in:
  - `apps/doctor-dok/package.json`
  - `apps/rasket/package.json`
  - `packages/shared-types/package.json`

### 2. Turbo Configuration
- **Problem**: turbo.json was using deprecated `pipeline` field
- **Solution**: Updated to use `tasks` field (Turbo 2.x requirement)

### 3. Package Export Configuration
- **Problem**: shared-types package was pointing to source files instead of built files
- **Solution**: Updated package.json with proper exports:
  ```json
  "main": "./dist/index.js",
  "module": "./dist/index.mjs",
  "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "import": "./dist/index.mjs",
      "require": "./dist/index.js",
      "types": "./dist/index.d.ts"
    }
  }
  ```

### 4. Missing Source Files
- **Problem**: Apps had no source code (only configuration files)
- **Solution**: Created minimal placeholder files:
  - `apps/rasket/index.html`
  - `apps/rasket/src/main.tsx`
  - `apps/rasket/src/App.tsx`
  - `apps/rasket/vite.config.ts`
  - `apps/doctor-dok/src/app/layout.tsx`
  - `apps/doctor-dok/src/app/page.tsx`

### 5. TypeScript Configuration
- **Problem**: rasket's tsconfig.node.json was preventing emit
- **Solution**: Added explicit configuration to allow emit

## Build Results

✅ All packages build successfully:
- `@doctor-dok/shared-types` - TypeScript compilation successful
- `@doctor-dok/rasket` - Vite build successful (dist created)
- `@doctor-dok/app` - Next.js build successful (.next created)

## New Build Commands

```bash
# Build all packages
npm run build

# Build specific workspace
npm run build --workspace=@doctor-dok/shared-types

# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Clean build artifacts
npm run clean
```

## Breaking Changes

None - all changes were backward compatible.

## Notes

1. The apps currently only have placeholder source code. Real implementation needs to be added.
2. ESLint configuration is missing TypeScript plugin but doesn't block builds
3. Build completes in ~9 seconds
4. Turbo caching is working correctly

## Verification

Run `npm run build` - should complete without errors and create:
- `packages/shared-types/dist/`
- `apps/rasket/dist/`
- `apps/doctor-dok/.next/`
