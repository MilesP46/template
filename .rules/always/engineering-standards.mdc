1. **DRY:** Before writing code, search the codebase for similar logic or helpers.
2. **â‰¤150 LOC per file:** If a file exceeds this, split into helpers or sub-folders.
3. **Single-Responsibility:** One concern per module/class.
4. **Modularity:** Prefer small sub-folders to avoid deep, monolithic files.
5. **Language-agnostic:** Apply the same design discipline regardless of stack.
