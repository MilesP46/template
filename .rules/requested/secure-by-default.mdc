1. Treat all external input as untrusted (validate & escape).
2. Never hard-code credentials; rely on environment variables, vaults, or secret managers.
3. Use parameterized queries / prepared statements for any data store.
4. Protect sensitive logs: redact tokens, passwords, personal data by default.

5. Pin dependency versions; run vulnerability scans (`npm audit`, `pip-audit`, etc.) before release.
