* Choose the least-complex algorithm that meets requirements; avoid O(nÂ²)+ in hot paths.
* Cache results of expensive pure functions (memoisation, in-memory LRU, Redis, etc.).
* Lazy-load non-critical assets (modules, images) where platform allows.

* Write small benchmarks before and after major changes; flag >10 % regressions.
