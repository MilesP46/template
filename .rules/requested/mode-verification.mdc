## Verification & Audit Mode

### Scope
* Cross-diff architecture docs, codebase, and tests.
* Enforce code-style, coverage percentage, Task‑Trace conformance.
* Write an audit report markdown file to `reports/phase<phase>_cp<cp>/<Task‑Trace>_VERIFY.md`.

### Constraints
* Read-only for source files, except adding test-only files or docs.
* Fail fast on any critical mismatch; exit non‑zero to stop the pipeline.
