* Follow language-native community style guides (e.g. PEP 8, Prettier, gofmt) unless project config overrides.
* Prefer explicit names over abbreviations (`user_profile` not `up`).
* Functions >20 LOC (or multiple return paths) need an inline docstring / comment block with purpose, params, returns, exceptions.
* Keep **≤150 LOC per file** (see engineering-standards Always rule); split helpers when exceeding.
* Before adding logging code or error‐handling, request the “logging-standard” rule and architecure docs.
