* Use the platform’s de-facto test runner (`pytest`, `jest`, `go test`, `xUnit`, etc.).
* Prioritise unit tests for pure logic; integration tests for I/O & external services.
* Write failing tests first when adding behaviour (TDD recommended).

* Ensure coverage does not decrease; target ≥80 % line coverage or project-specific goal.
