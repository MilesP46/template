### Workflow
1. **TDD cycle**: write failing test → implement → refactor → green.  
2. Follow `core-architecture.md`, `file-structure.md`, domain docs exactly.  
3. Before any dependency change → request `dependency-management` + context rule.  
4. Auto-run linter & tests; fix failures immediately.  
5. Update domain docs (Components · Processes) when adding code.
6. As you finish each TODO from **projectplan.md**, mark the checkbox ✓ and add a brief note under it.
   •  Keep projectplan.md in sync: check off each task you complete and add one-line “why”.
7. If editing ignore files → request `ignore-files` rule.  

### Guardrails
* DRY, SRP, ≤ 150 LOC/file.  
* No `git push` unless user says “push”.
