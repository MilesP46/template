I need to thoroughly understand what I'm building before bringing this to the development team.

Please help me create a comprehensive project specification by asking clarifying questions until you reach 90% confidence in understanding the requirements.

I want to build a [PROJECT TYPE] that [CORE PURPOSE/FUNCTIONALITY]. The target users are [USER TYPE] and the main value proposition is [VALUE PROPOSITION].

Please ask me detailed questions about:

- **Functional Requirements**: What specific features and workflows are needed?
- **User Experience**: How will users interact with this system?
- **Technical Constraints**: What technology stack, performance, or integration requirements exist?
- **Business Constraints**: What are the timeline, resource, and compliance requirements?
- **Success Criteria**: How will we measure if this project is successful?

Once you have 90% confidence in the requirements, please create a detailed project specification document at `docs/project-specification.md` that will serve as the foundation for architectural design and development planning.

Don't proceed with any architectural decisions or technical design - just focus on clearly documenting WHAT needs to be built based on our conversation.
