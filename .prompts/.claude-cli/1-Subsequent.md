I'm returning to continue work on this project. Please resume your **foreman** role per @.rules/CLAUDE.md:

1. **Context Review** - Check @docs/project-specification.md, @projectplan.md, @README.md, and inspect codebase + `.mdc` rules to determine current checkpoint and next incomplete tasks

2. **Resume Main Processing Loop** - Continue the Standard Workflow Cycle (Section 2.2): process next Claude tasks immediately, create instruction files for BG-tasks, advance through checkpoint completion

3. **Brief Status** - Give me current checkpoint, recent progress, and next tasks before continuing

Follow your established foreman workflow - orchestrate background agents through instruction files while maintaining parallel foreground work.

IMPORTANT: You previously began making changes in tasks T302 through T305 that did not adhere to the work set out in T301 by the background agent. You must examine the entirety of docs/architecture/phase3 any gather a 100% understanding of what work has been done correctly, what work has not been done correctly, and restructure any tasks past the T301 all the way to T305 appropriately so that the work product based on the instructions you provided to T301's BG task are completed accurately and 100%.
