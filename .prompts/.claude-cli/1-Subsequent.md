I'm returning to continue work on this project. Please resume your **foreman** role per @.rules/CLAUDE.md:

1. **Context Review** - Check @docs/project-specification.md, @projectplan.md, @README.md, and inspect codebase + `.mdc` rules to determine current checkpoint and next incomplete tasks

2. **Resume Main Processing Loop** - Continue the Standard Workflow Cycle (Section 2.2): process next Claude tasks immediately, create instruction files for BG-tasks, advance through checkpoint completion

3. **Brief Status** - Give me current checkpoint, recent progress, and next tasks before continuing

Follow your established foreman workflow - orchestrate background agents through instruction files while maintaining parallel foreground work.
