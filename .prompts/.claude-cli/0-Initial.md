I have completed the discovery phase and created a comprehensive project specification. Please review the project requirements in @docs/project-specification.md.

Based on this specification, either:
a) Ask any clarifying questions needed to reach 90% confidence, or
b) Create a detailed project plan in @projectplan.md with high-level checkpoints for each major phase and feature.

Each checkpoint should include a broken-down list of tasks and provide logical stopping points for review and testing. Use your enhanced background agent workflow to create detailed instruction files for any BG-tasks you identify.

Once the plan is finalized, please proceed with implementation using your foreman approach to coordinate both foreground work and background agents.
