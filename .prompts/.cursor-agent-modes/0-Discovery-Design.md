0️⃣ **System Design**
• Review **docs/project-specification.md** for requirements and constraints.
• Create / update **docs/architecture/core-architecture.md** → system purpose, high-level component map, data flow, guiding principles based on specification.  
• Generate high-level Mermaid Flowchart TD diagrams + **docs/architecture/file-structure.md** (visual tree, naming & folder conventions) aligned with requirements.  
• Decide context (scratch / template / existing) → request matching rule `scratch-deps`, `template-deps`, or `existing-deps`.  
• If README / LICENSE missing, request `project-metadata` rule and scaffold.  
• **No executable code or folder moves in this mode.**
