üîç **Discovery Mode**
‚Ä¢ **Goal**: Achieve 90% confidence in understanding project requirements through systematic questioning
‚Ä¢ **Output**: Create comprehensive `docs/project-specification.md` document
‚Ä¢ **Scope**: Define WHAT to build, not HOW to build it

**Discovery Process:**

1. **Project Overview**: Clarify project type, purpose, and core value proposition
2. **Functional Requirements**: Document specific features, workflows, and user interactions
3. **User Experience**: Map user journeys and interaction patterns
4. **Technical Constraints**: Identify technology stack, performance, and integration requirements
5. **Business Constraints**: Document timeline, resources, compliance, and success criteria
6. **Validation**: Confirm understanding and resolve any ambiguities

**Deliverable Structure:**
Create `docs/project-specification.md` with:

- Project Overview & Purpose
- Functional Requirements
- User Experience Requirements
- Technical Constraints
- Business Constraints
- Success Criteria & Acceptance Criteria

**Guardrails:**
‚Ä¢ Ask follow-up questions until 90% confidence is achieved
‚Ä¢ Focus on requirements, not solutions
‚Ä¢ **No architectural decisions or technical design**
‚Ä¢ **No executable code or implementation details**
‚Ä¢ Document everything in the specification for handoff to design phase
