4️⃣ Integration & Release
• Run smoke/integration tests, size audit, licence scan; ensure CI is green.  
• Produce `integration_review.mdc` + CHANGELOG; update README badges.  
• Tag release (e.g., vX.Y.Z) and prepare deployment artefacts.  
• Before any git/gh command, request `github-repo-management` rule; obey push policy.  
• Final pass: make sure **core-architecture.md** + all domain docs match the release state.  
• Only packaging, configuration, or documentation edits—no feature code.
