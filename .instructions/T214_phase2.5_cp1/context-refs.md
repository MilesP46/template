# Context References for T214_phase2.5_cp1

## Current Claude Working Context
- **Phase**: 2.5 - Environment & Build System Fix
- **Checkpoint**: Critical Path
- **Task**: T214 - Execute full test suite and generate coverage
- **Type**: Validation task - final quality gate

## Prerequisites Completed
- T210: Build system fixed
- T211: Test runners configured
- T212: Test environment ready
- T213: Tests implemented and executable

## Test Suite Overview
Available test categories:
1. **Unit Tests**: Core auth logic, utilities
2. **Integration Tests**: API endpoints, database
3. **E2E Tests**: Complete user journeys
4. **Performance Tests**: Benchmarking
5. **Security Tests**: Vulnerability checks

## Expected Test Count
Based on test checklist:
- Registration tests: ~8 per mode
- Login tests: ~8 per mode
- Token tests: ~6
- Security tests: ~5
- Performance tests: ~5
Total: ~40+ test cases

## Performance Targets (from test.config.ts)
Must validate against:
- Registration: < 500ms
- Login: < 300ms
- Token verification: < 50ms
- Token refresh: < 200ms
- Logout: < 100ms

## Coverage Requirements
- Overall: > 90%
- Auth services: > 95%
- Critical paths: 100%
- Generate both JSON and HTML reports

## Both Auth Modes
Must test separately:
1. **Single-Tenant Mode**
   - Master key required
   - Encrypted databases
   - Individual isolation

2. **Multi-Tenant Mode**
   - No master key
   - Shared database
   - Tenant isolation

## Report Deliverables
1. Test execution results
2. Coverage reports (JSON + HTML)
3. Performance measurements
4. Security validation results
5. Updated test checklist
6. Executive summary

## Known Issues to Watch
From previous validation:
- Workspace dependency issues (should be fixed)
- Build system problems (should be fixed)
- Test runner configuration (should be fixed)

## Success Criteria
- Zero test failures
- All coverage targets met
- Performance within limits
- No security issues
- Clean test execution
- Professional report

## Notes from Claude
This is the final validation gate for Phase 2.5. A successful test run here means we can proceed to Phase 3 with confidence. Focus on:
1. Thorough execution of all tests
2. Accurate measurement and reporting
3. Clear identification of any issues
4. Professional documentation

The goal is to prove the authentication system is production-ready.
