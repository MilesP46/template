# Task Completion Report: T210_phase2.5_cp1

## Executive Summary
✅ **Task Status**: COMPLETED
**Date**: 2025-01-29
**Agent**: BG-SCAFFOLD

Successfully fixed all workspace dependency issues and ensured the Turbo build system is working correctly. The monorepo can now build all packages without errors.

## Work Completed

### 1. Fixed Workspace Protocol Issues
- Replaced `workspace:*` with `*` in all package.json files
- Affected files:
  - apps/doctor-dok/package.json
  - apps/rasket/package.json  
  - packages/shared-types/package.json

### 2. Updated Turbo Configuration
- Fixed turbo.json to use `tasks` instead of deprecated `pipeline` field
- Configuration now compatible with Turbo 2.x

### 3. Fixed Package Exports
- Updated shared-types package.json with proper build outputs
- Added correct main, module, types, and exports fields
- Added build script for TypeScript compilation

### 4. Created Missing Source Files
- Apps were missing all source code
- Created minimal placeholder files to enable builds:
  - Rasket (Vite): index.html, src/main.tsx, src/App.tsx, vite.config.ts
  - Doctor-dok (Next.js): src/app/layout.tsx, src/app/page.tsx

### 5. Fixed TypeScript Configuration
- Updated rasket's tsconfig.node.json to allow emit
- Resolved project reference errors

## Test Results

✅ `npm install` - Completes without errors
✅ `npm run build` - All packages build successfully
✅ Build outputs verified:
  - packages/shared-types/dist/ ✓
  - apps/rasket/dist/ ✓
  - apps/doctor-dok/.next/ ✓
✅ Turbo caching working (0.27s cached vs 9s fresh build)
✅ No workspace protocol issues remaining

## Deliverables

1. **TURBO_BUILD_FIX_SUMMARY.md** - Detailed change summary
2. **scripts/verify-build.sh** - Automated build verification script
3. **All package.json files updated** - Fixed dependency protocols
4. **Minimal app scaffolding** - Apps can now build

## Notes for Claude

1. **Apps have placeholder code only** - Real implementation still needed
2. **ESLint warning** - Missing @typescript-eslint plugin (non-blocking)
3. **Build performance** - ~9 seconds for full build, <1 second with cache
4. **No breaking changes** - All fixes are backward compatible

## Next Steps Recommendation

1. Add real source code to apps (currently placeholders)
2. Install missing ESLint TypeScript plugin
3. Configure shared-auth packages if needed
4. Add proper test suites

## Verification Command
```bash
./scripts/verify-build.sh
```

This will confirm the build system is working correctly.
